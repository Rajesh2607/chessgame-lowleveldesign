Chess Game Low-Level Design (LLD)
Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to implement a Chess Game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. This low-level design focuses on creating a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture for the game, ensuring that key chess functionalities are encapsulated within well-defined classes and components.

The chess game allows two players to take turns, moving pieces according to standard chess rules, and determines the game's status dynamically based on moves and win conditions.

Scope
This project provides the low-level architecture required to build the core functionalities of a chess game. It focuses on:

Player Management: Two players, Black and White, alternate turns.
Chessboard Representation: The board is an 8x8 grid composed of cells, each holding a piece or remaining empty.
Piece Movement: Movement rules for chess pieces, such as Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King.
Game State Management: Tracks the game's progress, including turn management and game-ending conditions like checkmate or stalemate.
Move Validation: Ensures each move adheres to chess rules.
Requirements
Functional Requirements
Player Management: Supports two players, alternating turns.
Move Validation: Validates moves according to chess rules.
Game State: Tracks game progress (ACTIVE, PAUSED, CHECKMATE, etc.).
Win Conditions: Determines the winner or stalemate conditions dynamically.
Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Future-ready for AI-based opponents or online multiplayer.
Performance: Validates moves and updates the board in real-time.
Maintainability: Uses modular OOP principles for easy debugging and enhancements.
Class Overview
Class Name	Description
Chess	Main controller for the game. Manages the chessboard, players, and game status.
ChessBoard	Represents the 8x8 chessboard as a grid of Cell objects.
Cell	Represents a square on the chessboard. Holds the piece occupying the cell.
Player	Represents a player and tracks their color and account information.
Piece (Abstract)	Parent class for all chess pieces. Subclasses define movement rules.
Move	Captures details of a move, including start and end positions and captured pieces.
Enums	Color (Black, White) and GameStatus (Active, Checkmate, etc.).
Key Features
Chess Class
Responsibilities:
Manages game flow, including turn switching and move validation.
Tracks game state (ACTIVE, PAUSED, CHECKMATE).
Core Methods:
playerMove(from, to, piece): boolean
changeTurn(): void
endGame(): boolean
ChessBoard Class
Responsibilities:
Maintains the state of the board (8x8 grid).
Updates the board after each move.
Core Methods:
resetBoard(): void
updateBoard(Move move): void
Piece Class (and Subclasses)
Responsibilities:
Implements movement rules for chess pieces.
Subclasses like Pawn, Rook, and King define specific move validation.
Core Method:
validate(from, to): boolean
Code Snippets
1. Player Move Validation in Chess Class
java
Copy code
public boolean playerMove(CellPosition from, CellPosition to, Piece piece) {
    if (piece.validate(from, to)) {
        chessBoard.updateBoard(new Move(currentPlayer, piece, from, to));
        changeTurn();
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
2. Movement Validation for Pawn
java
Copy code
@Override
public boolean validate(CellPosition from, CellPosition to) {
    int direction = (color == Color.WHITE) ? 1 : -1;
    return to.getRow() == from.getRow() + direction && to.getCol() == from.getCol();
}
How to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-game-LLD.git
cd chess-game-LLD
Compile the Code:

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
Run the Game:

bash
Copy code
java Main
Future Enhancements
AI Integration: Add an AI-based opponent for single-player mode.
Online Multiplayer: Enable remote play between users.
Graphical Interface: Replace the console interface with a graphical UI for better user experience.
Timer: Add a timer for each move to increase gameplay competitiveness.
Conclusion
This low-level design document lays a strong foundation for implementing a chess game in Java. By adhering to OOP principles such as modularity, abstraction, and encapsulation, the design ensures scalability, maintainability, and future extensibility. The integration of components like ChessBoard, Player, and Piece provides a robust architecture for handling complex chess rules and game state management.
